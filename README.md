# FairySoulHelperMod

A Minecraft Forge (1.12.2) Mod to help with finding Fairy Souls on Hypixel Skyblock.  

***Disclaimer:* I based my decision to publish this on this mod being an alternative to watching YouTubers running around and helping you to find fairy souls that way, so I do not consider this an unfair advantage or cheating.**  
If you disagree, please let me know! :)  

Still, use this at your own risk - It will also destroy the fun of finding them yourself pretty quickly.

This works by checking the skull owners on the armor stands used for displaying the fairy souls & which particles are spawned around them - `PORTAL` being the effect for undiscovered souls and `CRIT` for already found ones.
